5. You should see a form like this. Notice the Select Faculty Sponsor drop-down list. The selected person will need to approve your request as instructed below. Normally it will be automatically filled with your previous sponsor. If you are not a full-time NYU faculty member, you will need an NYU faculty member to sponsor your application. This is probably your thesis supervisor or NYU collaborator.

6. Hit ``Submit``, and the request will go to your sponsor to approve (if applicable), and your account will be created, usually within a day of being approved.  You will be returned to the dashboard.
7. (If you are not an NYU faculty) Ask your sponsor to approve as instructed here :doc:`Approving Account <Approve_Account>`
