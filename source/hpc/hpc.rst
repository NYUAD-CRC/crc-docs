    New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) High Performance Computing (HPC) Center serves New York University 
    Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) researchers, faculty and students by providing them with HPC services and support to 
    help them conduct world-class computational research and education. The HPC Center provides its services 
    through a medium-sized Linux cluster called Jubail - launched in March 2022. 
    
    Named after Jubail Island, Home of the Jubail Mangrove Park, the first self-contained educational, 
    nature, and leisure destination of its kind in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.
    
    In Brief, it is a **2.24 PFLOPs (~33,984 CPU cores)** cluster hosted at NYUAD Data Center in Saadiyat 
    in 40 racks.
