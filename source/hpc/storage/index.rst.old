Storage
=======

We have 4 storage systems for you: ``$HOME`` (``/home/<NetID>``), ``$SCRATCH`` (``/scratch/<NetID>``), ``$WORK`` (``/work/<NetID>``) and ``$ARCHIVE`` (``/archive/<NetID>``).

In short, you should 

- Put all your data to  ``$SCRATCH`` and run your jobs from there. 
- Only a small persistent fraction to ``$HOME`` (e.g., source code, executables). 
- For long-term storage, archive them to ``$ARCHIVE``. 
- ``$WORK`` is not visible on compute nodes but mountable on your local workstation, best suited to quick post-processing, analysis and visualization, without moving your data.

Backing up is a user's own responsibility. E.g., if a user deleted something accidentally, we can not recover, unfortunately.

.. caution::
    Running jobs from ``/home`` is a **serious violation** of HPC policy. Any users who intentionally violate this policy will get their account suspended. 
    ``$HOME`` SSDs are not designed for this purpose, it will kill the SSDs quickly.

Know Your Quota
---------------


- Run ``myquota`` command in the terminal on the HPC to check your current usage and quota. Example output:

::

                             DISK SPACE                # FILES (1000's)
          filesystem       size      quota            number      quota
