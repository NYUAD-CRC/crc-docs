Account Lifecycle
-----------------
When you request or renew an HPC account, it is valid for one year. After this period, the account enters a series of states if not renewed, each with specific access permissions and data retention policies.
The account will have a state of the following: **Active**, **Suspended**, **Archived**, and **Deleted** where the following table summarizes them and their descriptions:

.. list-table::

    * - State
      - Duration
      - Access Details
    * - Active
      - 1 year from request or renewal
      - HPC resources and data are accessible
    * - Suspended
      - 3 months after Active
      - No HPC access; data retained (no direct access) and available on request.
    * - Archived
      - Lasts for 3 months after suspension ends (total 6 months from suspension)
