$ARCHIVE
========

In order to simplify the storage mount points and the user experience in storing their data on the 
Jubail HPC, We have merged the functionalities of two storages, ``$WORK`` (``/work/<NetID>``) and 
``$ARCHIVE`` (``/archive/NetID>``) into a single storage ``$ARCHIVE`` (``/archive/<NetID>``).

``$ARCHIVE`` can be accessed on login nodes as follows:

::

    cd $ARCHIVE
    # is equivalent to
    cd /archive/<your-NetID>

.. caution:: The ``/work/<NetID>`` has been discontinued from 2nd Feb 2023. The previous data in ``/work/<NetID>`` is 
    moved to ``/archive/work/<NetID>`` as a temporary staging area to allow users to move out their 
    existing data from ``$WORK`` to archive (``/archive/<NetID>/â€¦``). The ``/archive/work/<NetID>`` is 
    available for the users from the 3rd of Feb 2023 and would be deprecated after a period of 180 days.

When storage is shared among many users, rules must be set to prevent users to consume disk space
excessively at the expense of others. For this purpose HPC systems enforce disk quotas to users and
groups of users. The regular cleanup of the ``/scratch/<NetID>`` storage is essential to maintain its efficiency 
and easily manage the capacity.


The current policy is to remove any files(data) that have not been accessed (viewed, created or modified) 
for more than 90 days.

On the HPC disk quotas are enforced on ``/home`` and ``/scratch`` (not ``/archive`` ). There are two
quota constraints: the total amount of disk space and the total number of files. Once you reach a quota
limit your jobs may be killed. So it is a good practice to check your quota before submitting a job that
will generate a lot of data.

We urge our users to clean up their ``$SCRATCH`` storage regularily.

Run ``myquota`` command in the terminal on the HPC to check your current usage and quota. Example output:

::

                        DISK SPACE                # FILES (1000's)
    filesystem       size      quota            number      quota
                --------------------------   --------------------------
    /home         131KB     6442MB ( 0%)           0        100 ( 0%)
    /scratch      220GB     5242GB ( 4%)           4        500 ( 1%)
    /archive      418GB     5242GB ( 8%)           3        125 ( 3%)

What's inside ``$ARCHIVE``
--------------------------

The archive processes are described below in the form of a flowchart.

.. image:: /hpc/img/archive2.jpg

- The ``archive`` comprises of two types of storages:
  
  - Normal Storage (fast)
  - Long Term Storage - Tape Library (slow)

- **Process 1 :** The data in the Tape Library is synced with the storage every 12 hours, so that a copy of the 
  files is available on the Tape library as well.
- **Process 2 :** Once the usage of the total storage hits 80% , the system atomatically frees up space by keeping only 
  a copy of the file on the tape library (which can be retrieved later).
- The freeing up of space is in accordance with the access timestamp of the files which are oldest. 

State of the file in ``$ARCHIVE``
---------------------------------

Since the ``$ARCHIVE`` acts both as a storage soultion and long term storage (tape drive) as well, hence the state
of the file plays an important role in the same. There are essentially two types of states for a file in 
``/archive``. 

- ``archived state``: The file has a copy on the storage and the tape library as well.
- ``released archived state``: The file is only available on the tape library and has been moved (released)
  from the storage to free up space.


How to identify the state of a file
-----------------------------------

In order to identify the state of files in a directory:

.. code-block:: bash

  #dmfls -d <path to archive directory>

  #for example:
  dmfls -d /archive/wz22/abc

In order to identify the state of a single file:

.. code-block:: bash

  #dmfls <path to archive file>

  #for example:
  dmfls -d /archive/wz22/abc/input.txt


A sample output of the above directory command is shown below

.. code-block:: bash

  [wz22@login4 ~]$ dmfls -d /archive/wz22/abc
  ./hwloc/gnu/build.txt:  exists archived,
  ./hwloc/src/hwloc-1.7.1.tar.bz2:  exists archived,
  ./blat/src/bedGraphToBigWig:  exists archived,
  ./blat/src/liftOver: released exists archived,
  ./blat/src/blat:  exists archived,
  ./cufflinks/src/cufflinks-2.0.2.Linux_x86_64.tar.gz: released exists archived,
  ./cufflinks/src/cufflinks-2.1.1.Linux_x86_64.tar.gz:  released exists archived,
  ./cufflinks/src/cufflinks-2.0.2.tar.gz:  relaxed exists archived,
  ./crystal-analysis/gnu/crystal_analysis-0.9.12.tbz2:  exists archived,

It can be seen above in the sample output that the state of a few files is ``released archived state``  while 
some are in the ``archived state``.

How to Archive and De Archive
------------------------------

.. image:: /hpc/img/archive1.jpg

The above figure shows the following:

- The data from ``/scratch`` or ``/home`` can be moved/copied to ``/archive`` using the usual unix
  commands (``rsync,cp,mv``)
- The commands to copy out data from ``/archive`` depend on the state of the file. 

**archived state**

- Since the ``archived state`` refers to the copy of the file available on both the storages, usual unix commands 
  (``cp , rsync``) can be used to copy out the files from ``/archive`` to your ``/scratch``. 

**released archived state**

- Since the ``released archived state`` refers that the file has been moved/released and is now only available
  on the tape library, dearchiving the file would be a two-step process.
- It would have to be first moved from the tape to the normal storage using 
  the ``dmfget <filename>`` command and then can be copied out to the required directory in your ``/scratch`` using
  the usual unix commands (``rsync , cp``). 

A simple dearchiving would have the following steps:

1. Go to the required ``/archive`` directory which you would like to copy out to your ``/scratch``.
 
  .. code-block:: bash

    (base) [wz22@login1 ~]$ cd /archive/wz22/abc

2. Check the state of the file using the ``dmfls <filename>`` command.

  .. code-block:: bash

      (base) [wz22@login1 abc]$ ls
      xyz.txt file2.txt
      (base) [wz22@login1 lib64]$ dmfls *
      xyz.txt:  exists archived,
      file2.txt:  released exists archived,

3. (optional) if there are files in the ``released archived state``, use the ``dmfget <filename>`` command 
   to copy out them from the tape library to the storage to make them in the ``archived state``.
   This will run in the background and the progress can be tracked using the ``dmfmonitor`` command.

   .. code-block:: bash

    (base) [wz22@login1 abc]$ dmfget *
    Execute watch dmfmonitor <directory/file_name> to see progress
    (base) [wz22@login1 abc]$ dmfmonitor *
    xyz.txt: NOOP
    file2.txt: RESTORE running (0 bytes moved)
    (base) [wz22@login1 abc]$ dmfmonitor *
    xyz.txt: NOOP
    file2.txt: NOOP
    (base) [wz22@login1 lib64]$ dmfls *
    xyz.txt:  exists archived,
    file2.txt:  exists archived,

   Note that in the command ``dmfmonitor`` when the status corresponding to the file is ``NOOP``, means that
   the file is now back in the storage and in the ``archived`` state. 
4. Copy out the file from ``/archive`` to desired location in ``/scratch`` using the usual unix commands (``cp , rsync``).

  .. code-block:: bash

    (base) [wz22@login1 abc]$ cp -r /archive/wz22/abc /scratch/wz22/.

    * - Action
      - Command
      - Remarks
    * - Navigating to archive
      - ``cd /archive/<NetID>``
      - usual unix commands (``rsync,cd,cp,mv``) can be used  
    * - List the state of the files 
      - ``dmfls <filename>`` 
      - check for ``archived state`` and ``released archived state``
    * - Retrieve from Tape Library to Storage	
      - ``dmfget <filename>``
      - use when the file is in the ``released archived state``
    * - Monitor the state of a file
      - ``dmfmonitor <filename>``
      - Can be used to track if the migration from tape-library to storage is done.
   

Best Practices
--------------

.. list-table:: 
    :widths: auto 
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Dos
      - Remarks
    * - Periodically clean your ``/scratch`` 
      - Files which have not been access for 90 days in ``/scratch`` are deleted.  
    * - Once a project is completed move the data over to ``/archive`` 
      - Moving data to ``/archive`` frees up space from ``/scratch`` and avoids deletion of files if older than 90 days.
    * - Use tar files to archive directories with large file count	
      - Lesser the number of files, faster is the archiving and dearchiving process
    
.. note::
 ``$ARCHIVE`` can also be mounted on your workstation, Linux,Mac and Windows.
